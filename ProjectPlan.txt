------------------------------3D3 PROJECT 2 PLAN------------------------------

-> EACH ROUTER MUST BE ABLE TO:
	1. Send and Receive UDP Segments via its own UDP Socket.
	2. Encapsulate Distance Vector data in a UDP Segment.
	2. Exchange UDP Distance vector messages with neighbouring routers.
	3. Upon receiving a message, Parse it and use the data to construct a cost matrix
	4. Use the Bellman-Ford Algorithm to find the least cost path using this matrix
	5. If a new least cost path is found, encapsulate the new distance vector in a UDP segment and send it to neighbouring routers
	6. Write the Router's forwarding/routing table to its own .txt file.
	7. If a data packet is injected into the network, each router must use its forwarding table to move the packet to its 		destination.

-> Classes/Files Needed:
	-> my-router.cpp (main file for demo)
	-> router.hpp, router.cpp (header and implementation of router class)
	-> data_segment.hpp, data.segment.cpp (header and implementation of data segment class)

-> ROUTER CLASS: router.hpp, router.cpp

	-> MEMBERS:
		-> router identifier  (letter of router: A, B, C, D, E, F)
		-> int router_port   (UDP port # of router: 10000-(A), 10001-(B), 10002-(C), 10003-(D), 10004-(E), 10005-(F))
		-> other routers (array containing letter identifiers of other routers)
		-> link costs (array containing link cost to each router)
		-> int costs[6] (array containing cost to each router)
		-> outgoing ports (array of port numbers for next-hop routers)
		-> destination ports (array of destinaton routers)

	-> METHODS:
		-> Overloaded Constructor (creates a router given the name, port # and link costs)
		-> Getter Methods: GetName, GetPort.....
		-> Setter Methods: SetName, SetPort.....
		-> Print_Router_Table (Prints out Forwarding table for the particular router to the terminal)
