The purpose of this project is to implement, validate and demonstrate a simple Distance Vector protocol of the type that might be used by Peer to Peer, Adhoc, Wireless Sensor or Internet of Things communication devices. 

The project implements a router that communicates with other routers by exchanging UDP datagrams and uses a distance vector routing protocol that implements the distributed Bellman-Ford algorithm.
